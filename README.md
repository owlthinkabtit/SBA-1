With this assignment I was asked to simulate a real world work enviornment when it comes to creating branches on a project. Each feature of the project needed it's own branch, along with having specific changes done to the html that was provided. After each change, I had to commit them and also work on version control, which ment I also had to merge these changes to the main branch. Merge conflicts did emerge, and I fixed them by choosing which changes I wanted to commit. Once everything was said and done, and taking a breather once I got frustrated, I successfully finished this skills based assesment. Below is a screenshot of my peer review pull request:
